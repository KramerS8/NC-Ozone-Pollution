NC Ozone Pollution

By Sara Kramer

The map is centered on NC and use graduated circles to display the measured ozone concentration in parts per million (ppm) for each site. Tooltips and mouseover events are on each site to show the user where the site is and to display the site name and ozone concentration. There is a switch button at the top right corner of the map to display data from 2018 to 2022. The article about ozone pollution in NC is linked in the top right corner of the webpage. The article was written in 2018 and I wanted to show an updated ozone concentration summary for 2022. The legend in the bottom right corner features the graduated circles increasing in size based on the amount of ozone concentration. In the sidebar, there is the EPA logo, description of web map, and another link to the "State of the Air" report provided by the American Lung Association for users to look up their air nationally. My goal is to inspire further examination into what causes different parts of NC to contribute to ozone pollution and inspire action towards decreasing that pollution. The EPA is responsible for implementing and enforcing law instead of trying to rollback major safeguards that help fight climate change and reduce air pollution.
